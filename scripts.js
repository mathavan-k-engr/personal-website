```javascript
// scripts.js

// This is your JavaScript file.
// You can add interactivity to your website here.

// Example: You could add a "back to top" button that appears when you scroll.
// Or you could create animations that trigger on scroll.

console.log("Portfolio script loaded!");

// A simple example of an event listener
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
    console.log('The page is fully loaded and ready for interaction.');
    // You can start adding your interactive code here.
});
